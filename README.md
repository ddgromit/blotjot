# Blotjot

Blotjot is a real-time, multiuser whiteboard written in node.js that works both in the desktop browser and on Mobile Safari for your iOS devices.  Draw on your iPad or iPhone, see it at the same URL on your browser, and vice versa.

## Tech

Since it was rewritten from Tornado, its been javascript all the way down:

* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Socket.io
* Javascript

## Future

This was written in a few weeks as an educational exercise for myself and so is poorly structured and probably not too secure.  

* I'd love to rewrite this with [now.js](http://nowjs.com/), which would be an awesome tool for this kind of a project.
* Redis would make a much more efficient database engine for this purpose.
* Since this was written I've fallen in love with CoffeeScript, and would rewrite this with CoffeeScript on both the front and backend.
* Get android support, with their different touch API
